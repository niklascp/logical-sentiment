The program expects the WordNet data files to be 
located in the subdirectory:

	./data

The program communicates to the C&C tools through 
a small script (included in the bin subdirectory), 
which in turn communicates with the  SOAP client 
distributed with the C&C tools. The script expects
 the SOAP client to be located in the subdirectory:

	./bin

Remember to change the path of the input file to
analyze in Main.hs:

	reviewData <- liftM lines $ readFile "data.txt"           

Also remember to state domain specific seed concepts,
and the state the subject of interest of the analysis.

To compile the program:

	ghc -o main Main.hs

To run, simply execute main

	./main
