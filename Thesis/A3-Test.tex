no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites , coffee service in room is parred way down , the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful , although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish , check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .
