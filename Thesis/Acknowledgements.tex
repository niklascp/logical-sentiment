\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Jørgen Villadsen for his help and guidance during the entire project, and for his lectures in the course Formal Logical Systems (02156) which sparked my interest in the area of formal logic and later lead to my deep interest in computational linguistics. Also the courses Program Analysis (02242) and Functional Programming (02157) have contributed with knowledge crucial to the completion of my thesis. Finally I attended the 24th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (ESSLLI-2012) in Opole, Poland during the project, which also provided highly advanced knowledge that has been applied in this thesis.

I would also like to give thanks to Henriette Jensen and Johannes Svante Spurkeland for providing test data by individually labeling review texts. Further thanks to Mchael Lunøe and Johannes Svante Spurkeland for constructive feedback during this thesis.
