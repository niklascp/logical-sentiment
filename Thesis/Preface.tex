This thesis was prepared at Department of Informatics and Mathematical Modelling at the Technical University of Denmark in partial fulfilment of the
requirements for acquiring the MSc degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

The project concerns extraction of opinions occurring in natural language text, also known as sentiment analysis and the thesis presents a formal logical method as a proposed solution. The reader is assumed to have reasonable knowledge of combinatorial  logic and formal languages, as well as fundamental knowledge of computational linguistics. 

This project was conducted in the period April 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012 under the supervision of JÃ¸rgen Villadsen, and was valued at 35 ECTS credit points. The project specific learning objectives for the project were:

\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
\it
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understand and extend modern techniques for processing of natural language texts using formal logical systems.
	\item Demonstrate methods for formal reasoning with respect to natural language understanding.
	\item Present a proof of concept system, that is a fully functional implementation of essential theoretical presented methods.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}
